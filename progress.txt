    Initial checks for mapfile name, textures, player number, map characters, empty map are completed. 
    Initialization and more robust exit is required in case of error. 
    Map should be checked for being closed by '1' only.
    Player count 0 should also be handled. 
    Texture file type and accesibility needs to be checked.

- 28 Dec 
    More dynamic error handling.
    New files added. Structure is still an issue.
    All structs are initialized (but we will need more structs or to expand the current structs).
    Freeing is very modular. We need to keep it that way.
    Border check is progressing. 
    Added the libft dir and updated the makefile.
    Example maps are added.
    Empty xpm files are added (relevant checks will be added). 

- 29 Dec
    Initial checks for map file, map and textures are all in place
    Files need to be structured better
    Currently it compiles (without MLX) 
    Not working correctly. Will require further check - but good progress nevertheless :)
    Textures (MPM files) added.

    Parsing is actually taking place. 
    Seg fault fixed. 
    Map is parsed and values are correctly saved into structs.
    Memory issue for parsing arguments need to be fixed. 
    For non-rectangular maps, more work is needed.
    End of line '\n' issue fixed for textures and lines.
    
- 2 Jan
    Parsing is functional. 
    Resolved:
    	- Spaces between values for textures and colors. 
    	- Empty lines before the map section. 
    	- Order check is in place. 
    	- Empty line within the map triggers an error message for blank lines (including only spaces).
    	- Spaces following texture file name is handled. 
    	- No player and multiple players are handled.
    Issues:
    	- Open maps are not detected by the flood-fill it seems like. 
    	- Color values when non numeric doesnt return error.

    Resolved:
    	- Color values when non-numberic now return error. 
    Issues:
    	- Trim function overall requires freeing which I did nto do a good job with so far. 
    	- Open maps are not detected by the flood-fill it seems like. 
    	
- 6 Jan
    All parsing issues are resolved. Instead of flood fill, we check it all line by line.
    Each 0 is checked left, right, up and down. If met with space, returns error. 
    For unusual shapes, all emptiess is turned into space to check the 0.
    Currently, all maps are working correctly. 
    Feel free to create more maps and test. 
    Maps are divided into 2 groups as passing and error. 

- 7 Jan - branch: Windows @ Gabriel Rial
    mlx library is now linked with the game, in order to do that, I updated the Makefile, and also the t_game structure.
    We have windows, the size of it we can set up on "cub3.h" WIN_W and WIN_H.
    The windows also close itself when we press ESC.
    I edited the function free_game. Now returns an int, and free the mlx_ptr, and windows.
