    Initial checks for mapfile name, textures, player number, map characters, empty map are completed. 
    Initialization and more robust exit is required in case of error. 
    Map should be checked for being closed by '1' only.
    Player count 0 should also be handled. 
    Texture file type and accesibility needs to be checked.

    More dynamic error handling.
    New files added. Structure is still an issue.
    All structs are initialized (but we will need more structs or to expand the current structs).
    Freeing is very modular. We need to keep it that way.
