    Initial checks for mapfile name, textures, player number, map characters, empty map are completed. 
    Initialization and more robust exit is required in case of error. 
    Map should be checked for being closed by '1' only.
    Player count 0 should also be handled. 
    Texture file type and accesibility needs to be checked.

    More dynamic error handling.
    New files added. Structure is still an issue.
    All structs are initialized (but we will need more structs or to expand the current structs).
    Freeing is very modular. We need to keep it that way.
    Border check is progressing. 
    Added the libft dir and updated the makefile.
    Example maps are added.
    Empty xpm files are added (relevant checks will be added).

    Initial checks for map file, map and textures are all in place
    Files need to be structured better
    Currently it compiles (without MLX) 
    Not working correctly. Will require further check - but good progress nevertheless :)
    Textures (MPM files) added.
